Dungeons:

- The Drowned City of Skalla: unsynced. Tested with one account, i530 SAM. Completed the dungeon solo, needed self-healing reactions for 2nd boss. 2nd boss first wave of adds not handled well on melees (character doesn't move to them to attack). Other waves of adds handled but doesn't always kill all of them. Works fine on a solo tank or 2+ accounts. Needs mesh.
